Lawn Bowls is a sport I have loved since I was a teenager, watching my Dad play on a Saturday afternoon in the 1980's.
I joined Kallangur Bowls Club at the age of 19 and played for a couple of seasons before I got busy with my career as a Medical Scientist.
Much later in life, 1998 to be specific, I joined Wellers Hill Bowls Club, near my home in Tarragindi.
I was an on-again, off-again participant as our kids grew and family matters took precedence. In 2016, I got a call from Louie and Ray from the club - they needed players for pennants. The kids were finished school, so I played and it rekindled my love of the game. I had my 50th birthday party at the club in 2017 and my daughter held her 21st there in early 2020, just before the COVID-19 lockdown. I have been secretary of the Wellers Hill Bowls Club Board of Management since September 2018. The club has struggled to survive due to dwindling numbers of members and increasing costs. Post-COVID, the club has had to change, and to our astonishment, is growing at an enormous rate. We went from 350 social members to more than 1000 in about 5 months thanks to an investment in bringing in craft beer and the community garden. I devote a lot of spare time to the secretary duties, including maintaining the [website](http://www.whbowls.org.au), which is developed in html,css (Bulma) and nodejs (sergey framework) with Azure functions handling the server side bits. I am also looking at cloud based CRM and Asset Management, using our non-profit Azure subscription. I am planning to move the Website to Svelte once [Rich Harris finalises his replacement for Sapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHHLLJA0b70&t=24060s).
Go Wellers Wasps!
