### What have I been doing?
Those of you who know me have probably wondered what I have been doing in 2020.
Lawn Bowls has been a sport I have loved since I was a teenager. I joined Kallangur Bowls Club at the age of 19.
I would have joined earlier if they had a junior program. Much later in life, 1998 to be specific, I joined Wellers Hill.
I was an on-again, off again participant as our kids grew and family matters took precidence. In 2016, I got a call from Louie and Ray from the club - they needed players for pennants. The kids were finished school, so I played and it rekindled my love of the game. I had my 50th birtday party at the club in 2017 and my daughter held her 21st there in early 2020, just before the COVID-19 lockdown. I have been secretary of the Wellers Hill Bowls Club Board of Management since September 2018. My life has been busy ever since...any spare time I have, I devote to the secretary dutied, including maintaining the website, which is developed in html,css,js (sergey framework) with Azure functions handling the server side bits. I am looking to moving this to Svelte once Rich Harris finalises his replacement for Sapper.
